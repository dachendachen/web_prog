In this assignment, you will create your I6 web site using CSS and JavaScript. (If you are using I6 for another class, add a page to the top which directs the user to one of two subsites).
Create a site that visually has two part using CSS "containers." The left container will be the navigation, with buttons which YOU create in Photoshop. There should be at least five buttons, but you may have more: They should link to "Home" (your initial web page in the right container), "Assignments", "Web Programming Home Page" (i.e.http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0061-002/) and two other areas (perhaps "Personal", "Web Examples", "Resume" or any other items you like.)
Your Buttons should be JavaScript "roll-over" buttons. i.e., they should change in some way when the mouse cursor is over them. In particular, the button when it is rolled over should change to a picture which is a gif animation. (To create the animation, you will probably use Adobe Photoshop.)
The code for this operation is basically the script created in class. It is posted [here].
One of your tasks is to exploit CSS as fully as possible to accomplish the following goals so that all your pages look alike outside of the specific content. Your opening page - while different from the others - should still provide the same navigation, heading, and a consistent "look and feel". The goal is to do this without formatting individual tags except where absolutely necessary!
Your pages should have at least four layout items (e.g. header, sidebar, main content, etc) which do NOT use absolute positioning.
Your pages should reference at least one "default" style sheet throughout as well as at least one other stylesheet.
Use both the link and @import methods of calling styles.
Include at least one styled list with original bullets.
Include at least one styled table.
Include at least one image on every content page. The images on the content pages should all float in the same area of the page by using styles.
Define CSS rules for at least three original styles with HTML selectors; at least three original styles with class selectors; and at least three original styles that work with ID selectors..
Use consistent navigation so that the users can get to all of the pages from every page.
Use a consistent heading (either as text or a graphic) with brief information about the pages (e.g. "Poems by William Carlos Williams").
Use a background color or background image on every page. (They don't have to be the same for every page.)
You may fill the right-side of the "Home" web page with any material you like, so long as somewhere on the initial page it lists your name and class.
ALSO, Post your code from Assignments 1 and 2.
For Assignment 3, post a brief note explaining that Assignment 3 is site which the user has been using, and create links that will show the HTML, CSS and and JavaScript used for the assignment..
You may do this using any method you like, but one possible solution would be use a TEXTAREA. (Choose View source to see the code!). Basically, you would include this code:
<FORM METHOD="get">
<TEXTAREA NAME="ScriptArea" COLS="90" ROWS="20" WRAP="off">

<html>


// * * * PUT YOUR HTML AND/OR JAVASCRIPT HERE!!!! * * *


</html>
</TEXTAREA></P></FORM>
